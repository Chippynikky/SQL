-- In this project, I am querying a database that contains 2 tables of Netflix data using PostGreSQL. 

-- Shows JOINED tables
SELECT people.show_id, people.director, titles.title, titles.type 
FROM "Charlotte/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" people
LEFT JOIN "Charlotte/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
ON people.show_id = titles.show_id;

-- Shows number of titles that are Movies
SELECT COUNT (titles.type) FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech". "netflix_titles_info" titles WHERE type = 'Movie';

-- When was the most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies added to the database?
SELECT max(date(date_added)) "Recent Batch" FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech". "netflix_titles_info"

--List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order
SELECT titles.title FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech". "netflix_titles_info" titles ORDER BY "title" asc;

--Who was the Director for the movie Bright Star?
SELECT people.director, titles.title FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech". "netflix_people" people
LEFT JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech". "netflix_titles_info" titles
ON people.show_id = titles.show_id
WHERE titles.title = 'Bright Star';

--What is the oldest Movie in the database and what year was it made?
SELECT titles.title, titles.release_year 
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech". "netflix_titles_info" titles 
ORDER BY release_year asc LIMIT 1;
